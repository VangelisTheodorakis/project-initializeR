  |------>  info:         pdfs, powerpoints, docs, etc anything that is
  |                       not affiliated with the scripts
  |
  |------>  data-input:   data that will be used by the scripts but is
  |                       not generated by them
  |
  |------>  data-output:  data that will be generated by the scripts but
  |                       is not in a form of proper report
  |
  |------>  reports:      only files that can be shown to someone else
  |                       in a proper form
  |
  |------>  R:            all the R scripts, each one contating a 
                          prefilled description in comments
  
Execution:

1)  Put the files [project_initializer.R, DESCRIPTION, file_descriptions.csv]
