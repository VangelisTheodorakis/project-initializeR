### Project Scaffolding:
    
Project:
  * info:          pdfs, powerpoints, docs, etc anything that is not affiliated with the scripts
  
  * data-input:    data that will be used by the scripts but is not generated by them
  
  * data-output:   data that will be generated by the scripts but is not in a form of proper report
  
  * reports:       only files that can be shown to someone else in a proper form
  
  * R:             all the R scripts, each one contating a prefilled description in comments
